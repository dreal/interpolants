We develop algorithms for computing Craig interpolants for first-order formulas over real numbers with a wide range of nonlinear functions, including transcendental functions and differential equations.
We transform proof traces from δ-complete decision procedures into interpolants that consist of Boolean combinations of linear constraints.
The algorithms are guaranteed to find the interpolants between two formulas $A$ and $B$ whenever $A ∧ B$ is not δ-satisfiable.
At the same time, by exploiting δ-perturbations one can parameterize the algorithm to find interpolants with different positions between $A$ and $B$.
We show applications of the methods in control and robotic design, and hybrid system verification.
