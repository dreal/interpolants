\section{Examples and Experiments}
\label{sec:eval}

We have implemented the interpolation algorithm in a modified version of the \dReal which is available at \url{https://github.com/dzufferey/dreal3/}.
The interpolation hooks at the places where the proof is produced.
Since the proofs produced by \dReal can be very large,i.e., gigabytes, the interpolants are built and simplified on-the-fly.
The full proof is not kept.
